# AI Deployment Project: Image Classification and Moving Object Detection

## Overview
This project aims to deploy artificial intelligence models for image classification and moving object detection. The project will utilize machine learning algorithms to classify images and detect moving objects in real-time. Several other files will be loaded as the project progresses, documenting the steps taken and the progress made.
## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Set the static backround image using camerarunning.py, it will set base for comparison with any moving object
2. .....will be updated soon

## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python
- Tensor Flow
- OpenCV 
- Other relevant libraries and packages
